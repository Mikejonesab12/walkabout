# Walkabout #

Walkabout is a stochastic process simulation framework.

It currently includes Brownian Motion and Geometric Brownian Motion simulators.

In addition, Walkabout provides an easy interface to build your own stochastic process simulations.

## Local Testing and Development

Install the package dependencies.

In the root of the project run `python setup.py install`

## Examples

Navigate to the examples folder to see and run various usages.

To run `python3 brownian_motion.py`

## Todo:

* Add better documentation of features
* Add more types of simulations
* Return statistics about simulations
* Add Tests
