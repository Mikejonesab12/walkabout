# Walkabout #

Walkabout is a stochastic process simulation framework.

It currently includes Brownian Motion and Geometric Brownian Motion simulators.

In addition, Walkabout provides an easy interface to build your own stochastic process simulations.

## Local Testing and Development

Install the package dependencies.

In the root of the project run `python setup.py install`

## Examples

Navigate to the examples folder to see and run various usages.

To run `python3 brownian_motion.py`

## Todo:

* Add better documentation of features
* Add more types of simulations
* calculate in parallel with threads
* Return statistics about simulations
* Add Tests

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by this [blog post](http://www.turingfinance.com/random-walks-down-wall-street-stochastic-processes-in-python/)
